      Andrés loves to write beautiful code and enjoys working on pure
      implementation of programming paradigms, such as Smalltalk in the case of
      OOP, or Haskell for FP. He also enjoys learning new technologies and
      languages, working with agile methodologies and listening to (almost) all
      sorts of music.
